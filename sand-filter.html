    <p>Sand filters are used in the water purification process as a phase in the treatment process. There are three
      main types.
    </p>
    <li>Rapid (gravity) sand filters</li>
    <li>Upward flow sand filters</li>
    <li>Slow sand filters</li>
    <p>All three techniques are widely utilized in the water industry around the world. The first two require the
      use of flocculants chemicals to operate successfully, but slow <a href="https://poolwiseliving.com.au/">sand
        filter</a> may create extremely high
      quality water without the use of chemical aids, reducing pathogens from 90% to >99% (depending on the
      strains), taste, and odor. Sand filters, in addition to being utilized in water treatment facilities, may
      also be used in single family homes since they use materials that are readily available to the majority of
      people.</p>
    <h2>Rapid sand filters</h2>
    <p>The rapid sand filter, also known as the rapid gravity filter, is a type of water filter that is often used
      in municipal drinking water facilities as part of a multi-stage treatment system. Rapid <a
        href="https://poolwiseliving.com.au/">sand filter</a> were initially created in the 1890s, and by the
      1920s, better versions had been produced. George W. Fuller
      planned and built the first modern fast sand filtration facility at Little Falls, New Jersey. By the 1920s,
      rapid sand filter were commonly employed in major municipal water systems because they required less area
      than slow sand filters.
    </p>
    <h3>Upward flow sand filters</h3>
    <p>The Upward Flow Water Filter is a small, easy-to-build water filter for eliminating suspended dirt or organic
      matter that can discolor or contaminate potable water. The filter is especially beneficial in rural regions,
      where surface water of questionable quality is frequently utilized. Clean water may make a significant
      difference in a family's health.
      <br>
      The filter is simple to build and use, and it will supply enough clean water for a family or a party of
      around ten people. It can run for up to a year before it has to be cleaned, depending on the quality of the
      water source.
    </p>
    <h2>Slow sand filters</h2>
    <p>In water purification, slow <a href="https://poolwiseliving.com.au/">sand filter</a> are used to treat raw
      water and create a usable product. They're
      usually 1 to 2 meters deep, have a rectangular or cylindrical cross shape, and are mostly used to treat
      surface water. The flow rate needed by the filters, which generally have a loading rate of 200 to 400 liters
      per hour per square meter, determines the length and breadth of the tanks (or 0.2 to 0.4 cubic meters per
      square meter per hour).
      <br>
      Slow <a href="https://poolwiseliving.com.au/">sand filter</a> perform differently than other drinking water
      filters in that they rely on a complex
      biological layer that forms naturally on the sand's surface. Unlike its equivalents for Ultraviolet and
      pressure treatments, the sand does not filter anything and merely serves as a substrate. Although they are
      frequently the favored technique in many developing countries due to their cheap energy needs and reliable
      performance, they are also used to treat water in certain wealthy countries, such as the United Kingdom,
      where they are used to treat London's water supply. Slow sand filters are presently being explored for
      disease control in hydroponic nutrient solutions.
