        <h1 class="d-flex justify-content-center my-4">Pool filter cartridge</h1>
        <p>A <a href="https://poolwiseliving.com.au/">pool filter cartridge</a> is a piece of tubular filtration
            equipment
            that can be used in various products for an
            array of filtration requirements. A cartridge is encased within a housing or a casing and used to remove
            unwanted particles, pollutants, and chemicals from liquids. The cartridge is exposed to water, liquid or
            solvent that needs filtration, as it flows inside the housing and passes through the filter element. It can
            also remove submicron particulates.
            <br>
            You can find two categories of pool filter cartridge:
        </p>
        <li>Surface filters</li>
        <li>Depth filters</li>
        <h2>Surface filters</h2>
        <p>Surface filtration, as the names suggest, is concerned with the retention of particles mostly on the surface.
            The particles that are kept form a layer of material known as a "cake layer," which serves to improve
            filtering effectiveness even further. If the filtration rate is originally about 50-60%, it will increase to
            100% once the layer of cake is made. Solids and pollutants are prevented from passing through the medium by
            surface filters. They are limited outside of the filter media. Surface filtration is the flow of fluid
            through a layer of material that restricts particulates on the surface. The size of the particles that the
            <a href="https://poolwiseliving.com.au/">pool filter cartridge</a> prevents from entering the medium is
            greater than the medium's normal pore size. Over
            time, the surface filter becomes caked with particles on the outside, limiting the flow beyond what is
            tolerable. At this point, the filter surface must be cleaned and reused. Surface filters are less costly
            than other types of filters and have a shorter shelf life.
        </p>
        <h2>Depth filters</h2>
        <p>Depth filters are a type of filter that uses a porous filtering media to keep particles in the middle of the
            medium rather than simply on the surface. When the fluid to be filtered includes a high load of particles,
            these filters are often employed because, in comparison to other types of <a
                href="https://poolwiseliving.com.au/">pool filter cartridge</a>, they can
            hold a significant quantity of particles before getting clogged. To remove solid pollutants from the liquid
            phase, depth filtration is utilized, which is constituted by several porous layers with depth. The particles
            are trapped throughout the medium's structure, rather than on the surface, due to the tortuous and
            channel-like character of the filtering medium. Depth filters provide the extra benefit of being able to
            capture a large number of particles without sacrificing separation performance. The sand filter is a
            frequent feature of depth filters, and they may be employed with far greater filtration rates than other
            designs. These features have helped to strengthen the usage and popularity of depth filters as a separation
            tool. Depth filter designs are always evolving and improving to meet the demands of industry, thanks to
            continual improvements in process technology.
        </p>
        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <p>It's really quite feasible that dirt and particles are avoiding your filter cartridge. Look for tears in the
            pleats or cracks on the ends of your cartridge. Misplaced or misaligned components within the filter are
            another source of dirt getting around (rather than through) the cartridge. The position and arrangement of
            internal manifolds may be found in the owner's handbook for your filter. Look for fractures or missing
            O-rings in these internal components. Before putting the top back on, it's sometimes a matter of correctly
            "seating" the cartridge into the base of the filter tank.
            <br>
            Mineral deposits can block the small holes of a <a href="https://poolwiseliving.com.au/">pool filter
                cartridge</a> in hard water regions. As the water
            attempts to force through the blocked cartridge, your pressure gauge will most likely register greater than
            before. To address this problem, immerse your filter cartridge in a 10:1 water-to-acidic solution to
            dissolve the minerals.
            <br>
            Oily substances, such as suntan oil, cosmetics, hair care products, and simply plain old body oils, can clog
            cartridges. The oils in your cartridges may be broken down by soaking them in a TSP solution. If your pool
            has an oil problem, apply a pool enzyme like Pool Perfect to break down the oils. It's incredible!
