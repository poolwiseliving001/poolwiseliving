        <h1 class="d-flex justify-content-center my-4">Cartridge filter</h1>
        <p>A <a href="https://poolwiseliving.com.au/">cartridge filter</a> is a piece of tubular filtration equipment
            that can be used in various products for an
            array of filtration requirements. A cartridge is encased within a housing or a casing and used to remove
            unwanted particles, pollutants, and chemicals from liquids. The cartridge is exposed to water, liquid or
            solvent that needs filtration, as it flows inside the housing and passes through the filter element. It can
            also remove submicron particulates.
            <br>
            You can find two categories of cartridge filters:
        </p>
        <li>Surface filters</li>
        <li>Depth filters</li>
        <h2>Surface filters</h2>
        <p>Surface filters prevent solids and contaminants from passing through the medium. Outside of the filter
            medium, they are restricted. The passage of fluid through a layer of material that limits particles on the
            surface is referred to as surface filtration. The size of particles prevented from entering the medium by
            the <a href="https://poolwiseliving.com.au/">cartridge filter</a> is larger than the medium's typical pore
            size. The surface filter becomes caked with
            particles on the exterior over time, restricting the flow beyond an acceptable level. The filter surface
            must be cleaned and reused at this stage. Surface filters are less expensive and have a shorter shelf life
            than other types of filters. The filter media has a lower mechanical strength (with the exception of filter
            medium made of stainless steel).
        </p>
        <h2>Depth filters</h2>
        <p>Within the medium, depth filters capture all impurities, pollutants, and solids. Depth filtration is defined
            as a thicker layer of media (or many layers) that creates a difficult path for particles to go through and
            prevents them from passing through. The size of the particles is significantly smaller than the medium's
            typical pore size. Contaminants pass through the depth filter and become trapped; when the pores in the
            filter become closed, they must be cleaned with a reverse flow of fluid or replaced with a fresh medium. A
            depth filter is more costly than a surface filter, but it has a longer shelf life. The filter media has a
            high mechanical strength.
        </p>
        <h2>How to Clean Filter Cartridges?</h2>
        <p>To clean a <a href="https://poolwiseliving.com.au/">cartridge filter</a> effectively, remove any big dirt and
            debris particles before soaking it in a
            filter cartridge cleaning solution to remove built-up oils and scum. Remove the bigger debris using a garden
            hose, scrubbing between the pleats from top to bottom. The longer your filter cartridge lasts, the more
            thoroughly you clean it. It's not a good idea to wash it down and put it back in the tank right away. Give
            your cartridges the complete treatment each time you clean them.</p>
        <h2>When to Replace a Filter Cartridge</h2>
        <p>Most people replace their filter cartridges every 3-5 years, but don't base your decision only on the amount
            of time that has gone; instead, assess your filter's effectiveness. Depending on the strain placed on the
            cartridge, your time period may be longer or shorter.
            <br>
            There are three ways to tell when your filter cartridge is no longer effective.
        </p>
        <h4>Cleaning Frequency</h4>
        <p>When the pressure gauge climbs 8 PSI over normal operating pressure, it's time to clean the filter
            cartridges. It should be replaced if the period between these increases in pressure begins to reduce
            considerably. Keep track of the filter pressure and the date your <a
                href="https://poolwiseliving.com.au/">cartridge filter</a> was cleaned. It has
            reached its "half-life," and it's time to replace it when the time between cleanings is half of what it used
            to be.</p>
        <h4>Water Quality</h4>
        <p>: Another sign that your cartridge filter is expiring is if the pool water remains hazy or green despite
            correct chemical balance, or if you have to run your filter longer or use more sanitizer to get clean and
            clear pool water. Clean the cartridge initially, but if the problem persists after a few days, the cartridge
            is likely no longer capable of filtering the water as well as it once did. This is because the fibers split
            a little more each time a cartridge is cleaned, enabling fine debris and algae to flow through unfiltered.
            After 12-15 cleanings, Uncial recommends replacing the filter cartridge.</p>
        <h4>Filter Damage</h4>
        <p>The third technique to tell if a <a href="https://poolwiseliving.com.au/">cartridge filter</a> needs to be
            replaced is to properly check it every time you
            clean it, searching for rips or tears in the fabric. Damage to the filter will limit the filter's ability to
            filter effectively. If there are tears or rips in the cloth, or if the rubber end cap of the cartridge is
            cracked, it must be replaced.
            <br>
            Another method for calculating the time between pool cartridge replacements is to use the filter size vs.
            pool size tipping point.
